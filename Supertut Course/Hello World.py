# Why are comments important
# Increased Readability: Comments make the code easier to understand for you and others. This is particularly essential when working in a team.
# Documentation: Well-commented code can serve as documentation, helping others who need to use or extend your code.
# Debugging and Maintenance: Comments provide context that helps you quickly understand the code when debugging errors or performing maintenance.
